# Prado Energy Management System (PEMS)

Prado Power seeks to develop a solution that will:
-	Allow for remote monitoring of its installations at clientsâ€™ location and also empower clients to monitor and control their power sources (and or appliances) using a software (Web and or Mobile App). 
-	
-	Serve as primary monitoring and billing solution for its mini-grid sites. We propose that the developer review and rebrand the opensource Inensus MicroPowerManager software to incorporate at the least, all the functionalities of the current platform being used for managing our mini grid sites.
